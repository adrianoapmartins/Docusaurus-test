[Ship / Show / Ask](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html) is a methodology to increase the pace of software teams by not having to block developers for each pull request. 

It can easily be implemented with this new solution by specifying policies for teams to allow them to automatically merge certain PRs.

Hereâ€™s an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration file that we use in our team to automate these three processes.

```yaml
api-version: reviewpad.com/v3.x

labels:
  ask:
    name: "ask"
    description: ask mode
    # color is the hexadecimal color code for the label, without the leading #.
    color: "fd5e53"
  show:
    name: "show"
    description: show mode
    color: "ffd800"
  ship:
    name: "ship"
    description: ship mode
    color: "76dbbe"

groups:
  - name: juniors
    description: Group of developers that have created less than 10 PRs
    kind: developers
    type: filter
    param: developer
    where: $totalCreatedPullRequests($developer) < 10

rules:
  - name: onlyChangesMDFiles
    kind: patch

    spec: $hasFileExtensions([".md"])

  - name: onlyChangesTests

    description: All files with extension .test.ts
    spec: $hasFileExtensions([".test.ts"])

  - name: isSmallPatch
    kind: patch
    description: Patch has less than 50 lines changed
    spec: $size() < 50

  - name: isLargePatch
    kind: patch
    description: Large patch
